## Player Outposts

Syntax:

```
$outpost
<point> [<color>] [<name>]
```

## Mining Platforms

Syntax:

```
$platform
<point> <type> [<color>] [<name>]
```

You can place mining platforms after the `$platform` keyword. It needs a point for the bottom left corner. The given point will be rounded to fit the platform onto the grid. "type" can be one of `basic`, `intermediate`, `advanced` or in short form `bmp`, `imp` or `amp`.
